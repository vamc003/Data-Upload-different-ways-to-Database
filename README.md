## Introduction
This README provides a comprehensive guide for sharing data from FTP to a local directory and a MySQL database, as well as from an API to a local directory and a MySQL database, using Python.
## Project Setup
1.Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

2.Install virtualenv to create a virtual environment for your project:

pip install virtualenv

3.Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

mkdir data-sharing

cd data-sharing
